Dear team,

As requested, I’ve gathered various data samples for analysis and pattern recognition. Please read the full report below. Let me know if you need more `abc`, `b` values, or anything else.

This morning, **Alice** (user: `alice123`) logged in at **08:05:30** and wrote a message:

> *"All good here. See you at 10am!"*

Meanwhile, **Bob** sent a link to `http://example.com` and said:

> *"Try using the word **'Hello'**, not just **hello**."*
> Notice the capital and lowercase versions? Regex should match **both `a` and `A`** easily.

In another message, someone typed:
`The box contains 42 apples, 007 bananas, and 1234567890 berries.`
All those numbers are valid — both **single-digit** like `5` and **multi-digit** like `123456`.

Later, we found that someone used the password `StrongPa$$w0rd`, which is strong — contains **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **special characters**.

For testing character sets, try:

* A line with lowercase: `abcdefghij`
* Uppercase: `XYZ`
* Special chars: `^`, `@`, `%`, `_`
* Mixed: `aB1_` (alphanumeric with underscore)

There was an input with the word `cAtS`, which should match `(cat|dog)s?`.
Also: `ababab`, `abc`, and even repeated letters like `letter` (matches `(\w)\1`) were seen.

We encountered some interesting phone numbers:

* `1234567890` (simple 10-digit)
* Dates like `2025-10-07` and `31/12/2020`
* Time formats like `23:59` and `08:05:30`

Here’s a sample JSON:

```json
{"key":"value","num":123}
```

And a block of HTML:

```html
<div class="note">Welcome to the site!</div>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Some IPs were logged:

* IPv4: `192.168.0.1`, `255.255.255.255`
* IPv6: `fe80::1`

User emails included:

* `user@example.com`
* `someone@mail.co.uk`

Also URLs like:

* `https://www.example.org`
* `https://mail.example.co.uk/path?q=1`

A credit card was entered (test only): `1234-5678-9012-3456`
And a postal code: `54321`

The line `"x marks the spot"` puts `x` at the start. Also, `"end of the box"` has `x` at the end.
In `"xyz"`, the `y` is **between** other letters. Good for center-match.

For spacing tests:

* Tabs: `\tThis line starts with a tab.`
* Newlines: This sentence
  has a break.

To test repetition and greedy/lazy matches, observe:

* Greedy: `a...b` in `alphabetabbbb`
* Lazy: `a.*?b` in same line

Word boundaries (`\b`) work with `The quick brown fox`.
Non-word chars (`\W`) match symbols like `#`, `!`, or spaces.

Some people typed `Username_1`, others just `abc123`. Both are valid `\w+` matches.
Also check inputs that are only alphanumeric: `Only123` and `no_specials_here`.

Regex counted:

* Exactly 3 letters: `abc` (`{3}`)
* 2–5 digits: `42`, `007`, `12345` (`{2,5}`)
* At least 2 letters: `minimum`, `greedy` (`{2,}`)

Start (`^`) and end (`$`) of lines are tested using:

> `^Begin`
> `End$`

---

Let’s not forget alternation and grouping:

* "Do you like **cats** or **dogs**?"
* `(ab)+` matches: `ababab`
* `(cat|dog)s?` matches: `cats`, `dog`, `dogs`
* Backreference: `letter` → double `tt`

---

Please validate all the above using your regex engine.
If anything is missing — whether it's a backslash (`\n`), or a clever match like `(\w)\1`, let me know.

Kind regards,
